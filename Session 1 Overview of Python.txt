Session 1: Overview of Python
---------------------------------------

1) Introduction to Python:
   • Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language.
   • Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.
   • It focuses on code readability and simplicity.
   • Follows the philosophy: “Simple is better than complex.”

2) Features of Python:
   • Easy to learn and use
   • Interpreted language (no need to compile)
   • Dynamically typed (no need to declare data types)
   • Object-Oriented
   • Portable and cross-platform
   • Large standard library
   • Open-source and free
   • Extensible and embeddable
   • Supports GUI and Web development

3) Applications of Python:
   • Web Development (Django, Flask)
   • Data Science and Machine Learning (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow)
   • Automation and Scripting
   • Game Development (Pygame)
   • Desktop Applications (Tkinter, PyQt)
   • Networking and IoT
   • Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking

4) Python Versions:
   • Python 1.0 – Released in 1994
   • Python 2.x – Legacy version
   • Python 3.x – Modern version (used today)

5) Python Installation:
   • Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   • Install and check version using:
        → python --version
        → python3 --version

6) Python Execution Methods:
   a) Interactive Mode (direct command execution)
   b) Script Mode (save code in .py file and run)

7) First Python Program:
   Example:
   -------------------------
   print("Hello, Python!")
   -------------------------
   Output: Hello, Python!

8) Comments in Python:
   • Single-line comment → #
   • Multi-line comment → '''   '''

   Example:
   # This is a single-line comment
   '''
   This is
   a multi-line
   comment
   '''

9) Advantages of Python:
   • Easy syntax and readability
   • Rapid application development
   • Large community support
   • Integration with other languages (C, Java)

10) Disadvantages of Python:
   • Slower execution speed (interpreted)
   • Not ideal for mobile apps
   • High memory consumption
